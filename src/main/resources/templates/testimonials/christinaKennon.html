    <p class="lead">I decided I needed to get healthy and lose weight in April 2019. I heard of Maggie and thought she was what
        I needed to help me reach my goal. I started at a whopping 215 lbs on my short 5 ft frame. I felt terrible
        with digestion issues, sore feet, numb hands, trouble bending over, and I’m sure other issues that I’m
        forgetting about. One year later I am down 65 lbs and all those issues I had before have disappeared.
        I feel so much better mentally and physically! Thank you Maggie!
